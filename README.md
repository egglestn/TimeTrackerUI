# TimeTrackerUI

TimeTracker UI and https://github.com/egglestn/TimeTracker are investment projects.

Intentions:
* learn a bit more about Json API for rails
* learn about integrating google ids with an app

Investment projects are timeboxed so the code and UI may not be pretty: the primary intention is to learn quickly.
